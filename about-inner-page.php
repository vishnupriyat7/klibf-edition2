        Kerala Legislative Assembly is the premier of the glorious parliamentary tradition in India that came into force in the year 1888 as Travancore Legislative Council. Travancore has had its unique distinction of first Princely States in India to have a Legislative body. On March 30, 1888 Sri Mulam Thirunal Rama Varma, the Maharaja of Travancore passed a regulation establishing a Council for the purpose of making laws and regulations. The Legislative bodies of Kerala had three parallel courses of development namely Travancore, Cochin and Malabar until they merged together on November 01, 1956 to form the present State of Kerala.<br><br>

The Legislature Library has advanced parallel to the democratic system of Kerala. The Travancore Diwan's Office Library turned into the Legislative Library in 1921 and later with the formation of Travancore Cochin State in 1949, it developed into the Travancore-Cochin Assembly Library and when the Kerala State was formed in 1956, the Library got its present name, the Kerala Legislature Library. Out of the computerised Legislative Assembly Libraries in our country, the Kerala Legislature Library can contemptuously claim its prime position. In addition to its vast possession of more than 1,15,000 books and various records of historical importance, the Library is made available with Assembly proceedings since 1888, various Commission/Committee Reports and Acts in the digitalised format.<br><br>

The Kerala Legislature Library completed 100 years in 2021 and pertaining to its year long Centenary celebrations amidst the ongoing national festival 'Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav', commemorating 75 years of independence, the Kerala Legislature Secretariat has decided to conduct an International Book Festival along with various programmes scheduled to be held from January 09 to 15, 2023 at the Kerala Legislative Assembly Complex comprising of 100 to 150 stalls with the active participation of about 100 publishers from different parts of the world. The week long International Book Festival will be followed by art and cultural events which includes quiz competition, storytelling, book review, poem recitation and cartoon competition for school, college students and general public         </p>
